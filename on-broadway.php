						<b>For Immediate Release:</b><br/>
						<p>The Property is please to announce the multi-media exhibition <i>On Broadway</i>, featuring the work of Jim Campbell, Clay Dean, Jasper Fung, Theresa Sterner, Benjamin Bergery, Some Guy and Some Lady to take place the nights of December 12th, 13th and 14th, from 6pm to 11pm with generous support of LA City, the Tech Corporation and the Hotel Hotel.</p>
			<p><i>On Broadway</i> is a presentation of projected, lit and amplified works housed in each of the storefronts of the 440 Broadway arcade mezzanine.  The experience being somewhere between browsing a rambling museum and window shopping, viewers can glimpse each work through a glass wall and choose to enter each store-cum-gallery space to take a closer look and hear the artworks corresponding audio.</p>
			<p>The exhibition is free and open to the public and there is $5.50 parking available above the venue, cash only, with a performance by Blank to take place on Friday December 12th at 8pm.</p>

			<div class="artwork">
				<p>A slide projector and a video projector point to the same spot on a wall. The superimposed projections from the two formats cause the video projection of found home movies to be washed out and nearly indecipherable. Every time a new image or edit point occurs in the video stream, the slide projector moves to the next slide so only the first second of every new camera shot from the home movies is visible.</p>				
			</div>
			
			<blockquote>
				About 5 years ago I started making works that incorporated found home movie footage in a liminal way.  As the movies were presented in extremely low resolution, none of the details of the images were visible to the viewers giving them a somewhat "universal" home movie feel. Glimpse, which also uses found home movies, presents the films obscured/washed out by the light of a slide projector such that only the beginning of each camera shot is visible.  This structure makes Glimpse liminal in a different perceptual dimension compared to my other home movie based works.   One needs to use short term memory and edge recognition to comprehend the moving imagery of Glimpse.

				<i>Not West of Western</i>, 2011<br/>
				16mm, b/w, sound, 13.5 min
			</div>
			
			<div class="artwork">
				<p>Walking within parameters that define the heart of Los Angeles, Not West of Western explores the cross section of still photography and cinema while at the same time calling attention to the unique cross-cultural landscape of the city.  The short will be shown on film with a 16mm looping projector, mixing the hum of mechanical projection with the film's soundtrack of the Los Angeles freeway. Dean highlights the pedestrian's view of the city's center, pausing on neighborhood scenes before blinking and traveling on to the next tableau.  Not West of Western is an honest view of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles that just woke up and forgot to put on its make-up, or maybe even its pants.</p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="artwork">
				<p><i>Many small people</i> is a sound piece comprised of audio collected from two cities, the artist's homeland and dream-home, superimposed on one another, bringing the listener to three places at once, Hong Kong, Berlin and their present location in the abandoned mini-mall of downtown Los Angeles.  This Fall residents of Hong Kong are experiencing what it is like to have their freedom challenged both through official government interference of elections and unofficially through cultural dominance of newly transplanted wealthy Mainland Chinese. <i>Many small people</i> presented in surround sound on cassette, hints at Fung's position between fighting for the culture and city in which he was raised to remain independent and free, and dreaming of getting the hell out of Dodge and be an artist in the 'oasis' of Berlin. </p>
